## 1. Remove Nth Node from End of List 

---
**Prompt:** Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is sz. 
- 1 <= sz <= 30 
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100 
- 1 <= n <= sz

**Example:**
`Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]`

## 2. Palindrome LinkedList

palindrome
or false otherwise.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10<sup>5</sup>]. 
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9

**Example:**
`Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
