## 1. Backspace String Compare

---
**Prompt:** Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200 
- s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

**Example:**
`Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".`
