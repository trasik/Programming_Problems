## 1. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

---
**Prompt:** Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. 
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Example:**
`Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]`

## 2. Symmetric Tree

---
**Prompt:** Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. 
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Example:**
`Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true`

## 3. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

---
**Prompt:** Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>]. 
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Example:**
`Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3`
