## 1. Isomorphic Strings

---
**Prompt:** Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup> 
- t.length == s.length 
- s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

**Example:**
`Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true`
