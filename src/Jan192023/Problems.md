## 1. Fibonacci Number

---
**Prompt:** The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

`F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.`

Given n, calculate F(n).

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= n <= 30

**Example:**
`Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.`

## 2. Climbing Stairs

---
**Prompt:** You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 45

**Example:**
`Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps`
