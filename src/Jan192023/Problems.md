## 1. Fibonacci Number

---
**Prompt:** The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

`F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.`

Given n, calculate F(n).

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= n <= 30

**Example:**
`Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.`
