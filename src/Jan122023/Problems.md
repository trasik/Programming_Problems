## 1. Merge Two Sorted Lists

---
**Prompt:** You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]. 
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100 
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example:**
`Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]`

## 2. Reverse Linked List

---
**Prompt:** Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000]. 
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

**Example:**
`Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]`
